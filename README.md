Method:
Preheat your oven at 230 degrees Celsius (450 degrees Fahrenheit) for 20 minutes.
Cut the dough in 3 or 4 equal parts. Flatten the dough to a disk. On a lightly floured surface roll the dough having ⅛ to ¼ inch thickness.
Place the dough onto a greased and dusted pan.
Brush some olive oil on the pizza base. Spread the tomato sauce on the pizza.
Top shredded mozzarella cheese and veggies.
Sprinkle some grated parmesan cheese.
Keep the tray near or close to the bottom heating element of your oven.
Bake for 10 to 15 minutes at 230 degrees Celsius (450 degrees Fahrenheit) until the base becomes golden brown and the cheese on top melts.
Wait for a minute or two and serve veggie pizza while still hot.
